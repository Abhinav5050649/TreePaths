# TreePaths - A Text-Based Mini RPG

This is a CLI-Based Text-Based RPG created using C. It utilises the concept of Tree DS for the standard RPG Based scenarios.
It also utilises Inorder Traversal to free the memory allocated to the tree.
Last but not the least, it returns a file containing the maximum score(s) which you have been able to achieve based
on all the iterations of the game.

P.S. I have also added a few background noises to give the program a retro vibe to it ;)
## Requirements

1) A system capable of compiling and executing C Programs :)
